> Note that because of Electron's color profiling, VSCode on Linux will have odd colors.
> You can open DevTools and a color picker to see that the colors don't match up.
> Not yet sure how to fix this issue.
> It has to do with color space mismatches or a gamma correction, maybe something tied to srgb vs linear color space.
> Not happening in Zed editor, for example, as it uses the GPUI Rust framework.
